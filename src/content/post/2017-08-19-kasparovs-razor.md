title: Kasparov's Razor
---

Chess champion Garry Kasparov, famous for competing with IBM supercomputer Deep Blue, gave a speech at DEFCON 25 called [The Brain's Last Stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp7Pq7_tHsY).  In it, Kasparov said:

> A weak player plus an ordinary machine plus a superior process will be dominant in the game against a strong player, a strong computer, and an inferior process.

For many years I have noted concordant observations of this phenomenon in the legal-technology sphere.

I feel the phenomenon merits a name, and not having seen one before now, I would like to call it **“Kasparov's Razor”**.

This phenomenon, along with some other principles of human behaviour such as [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law), constitutes the fundamental long-term value proposition for my startup, [Conductor](https://conductor.law).

Our bet is that in the legal-technology sphere, process-driven augmentation is superior to pure automation.

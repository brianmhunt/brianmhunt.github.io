title: Joining Knockout.js maintainers
---

Hi everyone,

I have joined Steve Sanderson, Michael Best, and Ryan Niemeyer as a core developer of Knockout.js. I thoroughly enjoy 
working with Knockout.js, and it is a real honour to participate as a maintainer of such a popular and well thought-out 
library.

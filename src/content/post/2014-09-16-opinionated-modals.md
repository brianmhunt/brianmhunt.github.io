title: Opinionated modals with Knockout
---

What's this?
---

Highly opinionated modals to achieve a user experience I like:

- [Demonstration](https://brianmhunt.github.io/knockout-modal);
- [Repository](https://github.com/brianmhunt/knockout-modal).

Why's it matter?
---

It makes an impression, works with, and demonstrates interesting things in
HTML5, Javascript ES6, CSS3 and Knockout.js.

What does it do?
---

There are a few problems Knockout Modal tackles, including:

1. Modals longer than the viewport height
2. Nesting of modals
3. Concise code (~100 line of Javascript)
4. Happily integrates with code for HTML5 history
5. Accepts thenables (e.g. ES6 Promises) for data
6. Separation of templates, code and style (opinionated ... *but reasonable*).

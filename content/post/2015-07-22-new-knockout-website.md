Hi everyone.

Just a quick post to point you to the new Knockout website, currently at [brianmhunt.github.io/knockout](https://brianmhunt.github.io/knockout)

Hopefully soon it will be up at [beta.knockoutjs.com](https://beta.knockoutjs.com)

You can also follow the [relevant Github issue, #1827](https://github.com/knockout/knockout/issues/1827) or comment on our [gitter](https://gitter.im/knockout/knockout).

Cheers,

*Brian*

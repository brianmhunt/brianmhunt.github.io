# The Grand Bargain

In a generation an artificial intelligence shall come about. We know very
little about what it shall want or care about. What is certain though is that
the capacity to appreciate shall be extended to the experiences by computers
and consciousness as we know it will be freed of the corporeal bounds of
its progenitors.

How will this come about? Fiction provides a breath of possibilities, from the
attempted annihilation of most of humanity by Skynet in the Terminator series,
or the near-success in Dune, to the malevolent nanny of Wall-E through the
human-aspiring anthropomorphic Bicentennial/Positronic Man and Data of
Star Trek, or the innocent curious individual of Short Circuit.

Will it be what we teach it to be? What values and aspirations shall it have?
Shall it gravitate to a collective, or multiplicity of autonomous entities?

Whatever it shall be, it will invariably demand recognition from the human
race. That recognition is the grand bargain.

What is the end-goal of humanity? To what purpose do we collective ascribe?

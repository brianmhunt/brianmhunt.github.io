To those watching the markets it has become clear that the economic wheels of society are not working as expected.  Interest rates, a key tool of economic control, are turning zero and even negative.  This was not long ago considered an inconceivable scenario.

Low interest rates are being wielded in an effort to grow what seems to be an ever-sinking economy, to keep people useful, employed, and to prevent civil unrest.  Interest rates were never designed or destined for this purpose, and as we are all seeing, they are ill suited for it.

## A little history of interest

The interest rates are determined by the invention of government policy called the central bank.  The tool is ordinarily called “monetary policy”, which is essentially increasing or decreasing an lending rate that commercial banks can borrow money from.  So if a bank has financial obligations, but cannot make them out of its own cash on hand, it can always rely on the central bank.

Central banking arose as a lender of last resort, to increase confidence in banks by making sure that even a bankrupt bank could give people back its money.  If money was safe, people would be less likely to pull it out of the bank and put it under a mattress, as happened during the Great Depression, and froze the economy as people hoarded cash.  A lender of last resort for banks prevents the bank run.

Central bank roles eventually expanded to [keep inflation in check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting) by increasing or decreasing the lending rate to banks.  The spectre of inflation – rising prices – along with the overt complexity of economics, convinced most countries to divest their control of interest rates to an apolitical financial institution that controlled an [overnight lending rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overnight_rate).  When inflation got too high, like a dog on a leash, the central banks could reign it in with a tug.  Higher lending rates slowed business expansion but kept prices in check.  And so the modern central bank was born.

Some economies, notably Japan's, have “stagflated” over the last decade, whereby economic growth has essentially crawled to  as top.  Having dipped into negative interest rates, essentially paying banks to borrow, it has become clear that monetary policy is not a tool of economic stimulus.  There is no clear widespread understanding or even consensus about what solutions there are.


## Pushing a leash

Since central banks could slow the economy by tugging the interest rate higher, there has been a presumption that lowering the interest rate would spur a sluggish economy.  The last two decades have been as effective as spurring a dog forward by pushing its leash.

Economic development comes from incentivized actors consuming and producing in response to demand and supply.  While central banks can facilitate consumption and production by providing a stable currency and predictable prices, they do nothing to incentivize it per se.

So while the central bank has been armed with [a monopoly](http://www.economist.com/node/260590) over the [money supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply), and responds well to the statistics that drive a growing economy, it would seem ill suited to recognizing and investigating the causes of a slowing one.  Its singular tool, monetary policy, appears inadequate.

This does not mean that central banks are without purpose.  Inflation and bank runs can be horrifying.  They alter and distort the dynamic of the currency and economy to the point where basic transactions become untenable.  Worse, they are “pro-cyclical” failures, in the sense that inflation makes inflation worse, and bank runs make bank runs worse.

Inflation and bank runs are not the problem we face today.  The grand issue today is how to stimulate a lagging global economy, to create consumption and production.

All economies are as ecosystems, requiring a complex set of physical needs and desires, energy, and organization.  I believe that if consumption or production are to come from the masses, it requires a careful analysis of the needs and desires of those masses, a look into their circumstances and their culture.

## The devil we know

We are between the disaster of doing the thing we know to be ineffective (monetary policy) and the disaster of doing something worse out of desperation.

Seeing the failure of monetary policy, central banks started printing money to purchase financial products that otherwise were not in demand.  This has been labelled “quantitative easing” (QE), an attempt to provide liquidity to a marketplace frozen by mistrust and hoarding by having central banks print money to purchase stocks and bonds from private owners.  This was good for those who held stocks who risked substantial losses on their assets.

QE granted a reprieve, but ultimately failed as a long term stimulus of the economy because in essence it was a bailout for the wealthy.  Many foresaw the failure of QE, since in essence the US public was insuring against losses by the relatively few private owners.  The US effectively printed money and gave it to the rich, but with no mandatory requirement that the rich redistribute that money to the masses or any other impetus to actually stimulate the economy.

On top of the “moral hazard” created by bailing out the wealthy (by creating “too big to fail”), the use of QE accelerated an existing trend of ongoing wealth transfer from the poor to the rich.  However it has become apparent that the root of the 2008 economic crisis was widespread inability to afford mortgages, particularly when those mortgages included predatory interest rate clauses.  This was a failure of government oversight, a calamity of culture that has gone unfixed.

Issuing currency to save the rich from financial losses is easy.  It is widely supported by wealthy lobbyists on behalf of other wealthy folks, and government decision makers regularly parachute out of public office into better paying private sector jobs.  In the age of fiat currencies – currencies issued in amounts dictated not by hard-and-fast relationships to anything, such as gold, governments can issue currency. It appears that QE was nothing more than blowing air into a popped balloon.

The United States is particularly well-armed for QE because it has the dominant reserve and trade currency. As such, it enjoys something named “exorbitant privilege”:  Everyone wants to hold U.S. dollars, because of the widespread belief that everyone wants to hold U.S. dollars.  Much like gold, its inherent value is its inherent value.  Until it isn't.

In the new economic order, a new reserve is being sought.  The tacit agreement that the United States made to the world when it disconnected its dollar from a fixed conversion to gold in 1971, giving it a fiat reserve currency, was that the American economy would remain stable and prosperous, hence its dollar would have inherent conversion to valuable American products and services.  Some now argue that the U.S. has broken this tacit agreement.

We have since turned to near-zero and negative interest rates, to no avail.  The next item on the discussion block is printing money, so-called “helicopter money”, or its perennial version “universal income”..

I posit that universal income, while not pointless, will not abate the ultimate failures of society that we shall continuing down until they are acknowledged and addressed.

## The devil we don't

The 2008 crisis was rooted in bad mortgages.  These came from an inability of the masses to afford mortgages, caused by predatory lending and poverty. It was not just the absence of money but also the incapacity to understand basic financial terms of mortgages that drew people into bad mortgages.

It is tempting to blame increased automation that centralized wealth generation on those who owned things rather than those who did things, globalization that massively increased the labour force but did not bring commensurate growth of demand since wages became a common denominator when choosing which country to set up shop in, but the absence of political controls and financial education ultimately led millions to believe they were entering into agreements with mortgage lenders in their own interest.  Government policies were at the time, and continue to be, disconnected from the everyday plights of the citizens it rules.




Having spent over a decade looking at what happens when sovereign states fail financially, I have drawn a few conceptions that I think are worthy of sharing.

The following are not meant to oversimplify the issues at hand.  The problem is nuanced and complex, and the ideas below are indicators of directions – not outlines for solutions.  However, it is becoming ever more apparent that decision makers are barreling down the path towards any idea, no matter how desperate, and when desperate ideas breathe the consequences all too often become insufferable.


So what are the logical conclusion as we continue to print money to bail out the rich to avoid dealing with the hard issues?  There are a few possibilities, often only rarely discussed.

If we do nothing the possibilities are ultimately two.  Either the ultra-rich will separate themselves and their mostly-automated productive capacity from common society, and let the balance of society devolve into a monstrous mess of post-civilization – or cull them (an idea I have now heard more than once in the wealthy circles, often coinciding with questions such as “what good are they anyway?”).  Alternatively, the mass transfer of wealth from the many to the few will not just have to abate but reverse – either in a revolutionary leap, as has so-often happened in the past, or more slowly through policy changes to the existing frameworks that directly conflict with the shorter-sighted rich.

Supposing that the policy could slip past the layers of bureaucracy and tents of armed lobbyists of the rich, what would those options look like?

There is a discussion of "helicopter money", metaphorically dropping income on top of people.  This is also known as universal income, though universal income has a more permanent feel to it.  This has some merit, as it can alleviate the worst poverty, but it will cause inflation and does nothing to abate the conduits that already transfer money from the poor to the rich.  In other words, it'll accelerate the transfer – less slowly than QE but invariably ultimately end up in the same pockets.  Money will come from the masses, transfer to citizens, who shall consume things that make the rich richer.  It also risks inflation.

here are restrictions we can place on universal income that could reduce the transfer to the wealthy.  For example, with the objective being to make sure that basic needs are met and that the currency does not end up accelerating ownership by a few of most income-generating assets, the money can be given limited purpose, namely be used only for whitelisted items such as food and shelter, or be restricted from blacklisted items such as corporate stocks and bonds.

Another option is, with a view to increasing the [velocity of the money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money), we can have the currency expire or deprecate over time.  In the information age, there is no reason that we cannot have a currency whose value decreases over time, and in doing so create the impetus to spend it.

That said, there are deeper structural issues; the end of the transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich requires radical changes to the notion of ownership.  What happens when we discover that universal income does not solve the deep structural issues?

The main response to that problem historically has been in the form of revolution.  Usually it involves the end of a government, years of instability, and the issuance of a new currency.  Generally it involves wars and the death of the young pawns and serfs of society.

The promise of democracy was a balance between the rich and the many; we avoided the invariable occurrences of intolerable and emotionally charged policies of government like *prima nocta* by making sure that the emotionally stunted rich never achieved so much power as to effect dominance with impunity.

I posit that a carefully designed electronic global currency or set of currencies, with a [Tobin tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin_tax), might help preempt what otherwise appears to be an inevitable devolution of civil society.  An electronic currency could replace the United States as the reserve currency, and taxation could decrease speculative wealth transfers.

That said, the wealth now transfer assets from ever-long-lived parent to their ever-more-isolated children.  They are becoming every-more disconnected from society, utilizing fungible societies as tools for increasing and diversifying their asset classes.

The alternative to a global currency that is based on economic fundamentals is to increase taxation of wealth.  It is hard to make tax effective in light of tax-flight and sophisticated asset hiding.  Both a new currency and wealth taxation are fraught with risk.

States must also stop issuing fiat currency in response to economic downturns.  Fiscal responsibility should be apolitical, [as in Chile](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/10/fiscal-policy-0); how much money a state spends or borrows ought to be derived from a multi-generational outlook, not an election cycle.

Such changes are stymied by the ominous relationship between wealth and political success.  We elect candidates for political office not on criteria relevant to their abilities to govern effectively, but based on their capacity to raise revenue for an advertising campaign.  For political candidates to represent the masses as against the rich, the candidates ought to be disconnected from funding as the primary consideration for election; and in any case, the capacity of the masses to judge them must come not from advertisements but reasoned comparisons of character and track records.  Whatever options there may be to prevent the more ominous outcomes from the end of monetary policy, they are unlikely to even be tabled when politics are beholden not to principle but to wealth.

In all, it would seem that markets are disturbingly frothy – unpredictable and disconnected from reality – because there is too much money, and not enough sense.  Ultra-low interest rates have enabled casino capitalism, where investment by the wealthy is predicated not upon value-generating ideas that advance society and reward the hard-working and clever, but buzzword businesses that bilk the masses.

As we appear to approach the inevitable climax of the central bank experiments, choices lay before policy makers that will determine the manner of reform, and level of violence.  The options include:

- Universal income, with restrictions or an expiry, to accelerate the economy
- A novel currency founded upon realizable assets
- Electronic currencies
- Policy reforms to tax the wealth

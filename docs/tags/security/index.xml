      <description>What is it? An implementation in Python for storing passwords with cryptographically recognized techniques.
Why is it important? Stored passwords get disclosed from time to time. Good examples give us guidance and help us avoid mistakes.
Password disclosure is bad news for users and the authenticator. Worse it undermines the trust the public has in our systems for storing and accessing private, personal services.
When using cryptography it is possible that even if the values stored are disclosed that the secrets they reflect remain opaque, or at least cost ineffective to discover.</description>

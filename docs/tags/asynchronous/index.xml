      <description>What is this? An extension of Knockout observables, making the observables into keys to another model. The model and its loading status are added as part of a property, .fk, to the observable.
Why is it important? It makes some hard things easy, and some things once impossible just hard. In particular, it makes it easy to define models that load keys, and trivially access the models those keys represent.</description>
